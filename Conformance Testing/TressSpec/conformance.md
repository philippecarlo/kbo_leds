# Conformance Testing framework 
*The current framework is made for conforming the test points regarding the [Tree Spec](https://treecg.github.io/specification/)*

Which contains:
 - [ðŸŸ¥ Must](#the-tree-specification-must-) 
 - [ðŸŸ¨ Should](#the-tree-specification-should-)
 - [ðŸŸ© Optional](#the-tree-specification-optional-)



# [The Tree Specification](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction) [MustðŸŸ¥]

## [Collections](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction)
## [Core Concept](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#core-concepts)
#### *When the current page is a tree:Node, there MUST be a property linking the current page URL to the URI of the tree:Collection.*
		    

 - [ ] LDES Server, a tree:Node has a link between current page to tree:Collection
	 - [ ]  Geo-based fragment 
	 - [ ]  Substring fragment
	 - [ ]  Time-based fragment
	 - [ ]  pagination fragment 

####  *Every entity linked from tree:view MUST be an entry point to retrieve all members of the collection.*	

 - [ ] LDES client retrieves the full collection from the link of  tree:view
 - [ ] Check the integrity of the retrieved dataset
 - [ ] All supporting fragments
	 - [ ]  Geo-based fragment 
	 - [ ]  Substring fragment
	 - [ ]  Time-based fragment
	 - [ ]  pagination fragment 

####	*A TREE client MUST traverse all relations from the tree:Nodes linked to this particular collection.*

 - [ ] Same as previous points
 - [ ] Check the reaction of the LDES Client when the relation is more than one. [LDES Client Must Not crash]
 
####	*A client MUST thus check for ViewDescriptions on both the current node without the tree:viewDescription qualification, as on the current node with the tree:viewDescription link.*
	
 - [ ] LDES client retrieves all dataset if there is tree:viewDescription
 - [ ] LDES client retrieves all dataset if there is NO tree:viewDescription

## [Relations](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#relations)
####	*A tree:Relation MUST have one tree:node object of the type tree:Node.*

####	*When no tree:path is defined, the tree:value MUST be compared to all membersâ€™ triples that can be compared to the tree:value as defined by the type of the relation (or when no members or collection are defined, on every triple in the page).When due to rdfs:range incompatibility, the object cannot be compared, the object will not be considered for comparison.*

## [Searching through the collection](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#searching)
## [Imports](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#imports)
####     *No hypermedia controls in the body MUST be interpreted in the imported resource and the object must be fully contained within that information resource.*


# [The Tree Specification](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction) [Should ðŸŸ¨]
##	[Collections](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction)
##	[Core Concept](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#core-concepts)
#### *Therefore a data publisher SHOULD annotate a tree:Collection instance with a SHACL shape. The tree:shape points to a SHACL description of the shape (sh:NodeShape).*
#### *A client picks the right view that is use-case specific and can be prioritized by studying the tree:ViewDescriptionâ€™s properties. To fetch all members, one can be chosen at random if no specific tree:ViewDescription is given.*
##	[Relations](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#relations)
#### *The tree:Relationâ€™s tree:value SHOULD be set.*
#### *The object of tree:value SHOULD be accompanied by a data type when it is a literal value.*
#### *Every tree:Relation SHOULD have a tree:path, indicating the path from the member to the object on which the tree:Relation applies.*
#### *A client SHOULD keep a list of already visited pages*
#### *When using relations such as tree:LessThanRelation or tree:GreaterThanRelation, the time literals need to be compared according to these 3 possible data types: xsd:date, xsd:dateTime or xsd:dateTimeStamp.*

 - [ ] LDES Client persistency

# [The Tree Specification](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction) [Optional ðŸŸ©]
##	[Collections](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction)
##	[Core Concept](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#core-concepts)
####	Multiple tree:view links MAY be provided
##	[Relations](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#relations)

####  *A tree:Node element MAY have one or more tree:relation properties.*
####	*A relation is an entity of the type tree:Relation, and MAY have a more specific type.*
####	*Every tree:Relation MAY provide a tree:remainingItems.*
####	*A client MAY use tree:remainingItems to estimate the completeness of the downloaded elements to the end-user.*
####	*A tree:import MAY be defined in the tree:Relation instance.*
