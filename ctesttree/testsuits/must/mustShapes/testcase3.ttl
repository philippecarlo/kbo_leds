# SPEC for Tree Spec
# Must test case - 6 AND 8
# SPEC Conform:
# Every entity linked from tree:view MUST be an entry point to retrieve all members of the collection.
# AND
# A TREE client MUST traverse all relations from the tree:Nodes linked to this particular collection.
# A client MUST thus check for ViewDescriptions on both the current node without the tree:viewDescription qualification,
# Verify:
# The amount of the LDES members = The Input LDES members (20, in the context of BEL20, KBO data).
