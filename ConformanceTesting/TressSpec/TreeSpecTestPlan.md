 - [ ] Geo-based fragment   
 - [ ] Substring fragment   
 - [ ] Time-based fragment  
 - [ ] Pagination fragment  
  
## ‚ùóÔ∏è ‚ùóÔ∏è ***To meet the conformance standard*** ‚ùóÔ∏è ‚ùó  
- The under-testing component is possible to be configured to performance the test case.  
- The test output meets the expectation of the test case.
