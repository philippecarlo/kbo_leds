# Conformance Testing framework 
*The current framework is made for conforming the test points regarding the [Tree Spec](https://treecg.github.io/specification/)*
Which contains:
 - [ðŸŸ¥ Must](#the-tree-specification-must-) 
 - [ðŸŸ¨ Should](#the-tree-specification-should-)
 - [ðŸŸ¦ Optional](#the-tree-specification-optional-)

# [1. The Tree Specification](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction) [MustðŸŸ¥]

> When the MUST-test fails, the server is considered non-conformant. The conformance score will be zero.

## [1.1 Collections](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction)
## [1.2 Core Concept](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#core-concepts)

#### *1.2.1 When the current page is a tree:Node, there MUST be a property linking the current page URL to the URI of the tree:Collection.*		    

 - [ ] Check that after processing by the LDES Server, each tree:Node has a link between current page to tree:Collection

####  *1.2.2 Every entity linked from tree:view MUST be an entry point to retrieve all members of the collection.*	

 - [ ] Verify that the LDES Client can retrieve the full collection from the tree:view page
 - [ ] Check the integrity of the retrieved dataset

####	*1.2.3 A TREE client MUST traverse all relations from the tree:Nodes linked to this particular collection. A client MUST thus check for ViewDescriptions on both the current node without the tree:viewDescription qualification, as on the current node with the tree:viewDescription link.*

 - [ ] Verify correct behavior of the LDES Client when the relation is more than one. [LDES Client Must Not crash or get stuck in an endless loop]	
> #FIXME: client conformance included?
 - [ ] Verify that the LDES client retrieves all datasets if there is tree:viewDescription
> #FIXME not sure if this is an actual conformance test
> Rephrased: regardless of the startting point (a node in the middle or the root node), it should be possible to retrieve/discover all members of the dataset including the collection definition and the view description (by following the relations).
 - [ ] Verify that the LDES client retrieves all datasets if there is NO tree:viewDescription
> #FIXME not sure if this is an actual conformance test

## [1.3 Relations](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#relations)
####	*1.3.1 A tree:Relation MUST have one tree:node object of the type tree:Node.*
- [ ] Check that every tree:Relation has one tree:node object of type tree:Node 
####	*1.3.2 The result of the evaluation of the tree:path, is the value that MUST be compared to the tree:value.*
- [ ] Check if the evaluation based on the tree:path is as expected.
####	*1.3.3 When no tree:path is defined, the tree:value MUST be compared to all membersâ€™ triples that can be compared to the tree:value as defined by the type of the relation (or when no members or collection are defined, on every triple in the page). When due to rdfs:range incompatibility, the object cannot be compared, the object will not be considered for comparison.*
- [ ] Check that when no tree:path is defined, all member triple objects on the page containing the relationship that can be compared to the specified tree:value satisfy the relationship. Objects that cannot be compared to the relationship value are not considered for comparison.
- [ ] Check that when no tree:path is defined and no member or collection is specified all triple objects on the page containing the relationship that can be compared to the specified tree:value satisfy the relationship. Objects that cannot be compared to the relationship value are not considered for comparison.

####	*1.3.4 When the only type given for a certain Relation is tree:Relation, then the client must dereference all of the nodes.*
####	*1.3.5 The strings MUST then be compared according to case sensitive unicode ordering.*
- [ ] Verify that string-based fragmentations use case sensitive unicode ordering.
- [ ] Verify that when no langauge is set in the tree:path, strings of all langaueges are used for comparison.
####	*1.3.6 When using tree:GeospatiallyContainsRelation, the tree:path MUST refer to a literal containing a WKT string, such as geosparql:asWKT.*
- [ ] Verify that when using tree:GeospatiallyContainsRelation, the tree:path refers to a literal containing a WKT string, such as geosparql:asWKT.

## [1.4 Searching through the collection](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#searching)
## [1.5 Imports](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#imports)

####    *1.5.1 When defined as part of the `tree:Relation`, one MUST fetch the import when the relation needs to be correctly evaluated (e.g., the resulting page contains elements without materialized WKT strings, which however can be fetched from the import).*
####    *1.5.2 No hypermedia controls in the body MUST be interpreted in the imported resource and the object must be fully contained within that information resource.*
####    *1.5.3 LDP Containers: If this container is paged by the [[!ldp-paging]] (chapter 7) spec, then this MUST be ignored.*
####    *1.5.4 LDP Containers: If there is an ordering, this MUST be ignored by TREE clients (the relations contain all necessary information for pruning).*

# [2 The Tree Specification](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction) [Should ðŸŸ¨]
> When the SHOULD tests fails, the tested LDES server can still conform to the recommendation. However, the conformance score will be impacted and the maintainer of the LDES server needs to consider alignment. The only strict requirement is that the server handles the test gracefully. Failure to do so will result in non-conformance.

##	[2.1 Collections](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction)
##	[2.2 Core Concept](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#core-concepts)
#### *2.2.1 Therefore a data publisher SHOULD annotate a tree:Collection instance with a SHACL shape. The tree:shape points to a SHACL description of the shape (sh:NodeShape).*
- [ ] Check that when the LDES collection is annotated with a SHACL shape, all members of the collection are validated against the SHACL shape
#### *2.2.2 Note: the shape can be a blank node, or a named node on which you should follow your nose when it is defined at a different HTTP URL.*
- [ ] Check when LDES stream is set with a blank node or named node and the shape can be resolved, all members conform to the shape
#### *2.2.3 A client picks the right view that is use-case specific and can be prioritized by studying the tree:ViewDescriptionâ€™s properties. To fetch all members, one can be chosen at random if no specific tree:ViewDescription is given.*
- [ ] Check when there are several views and no tree:ViewDescription, LDES client works as expected
- [ ] Check when there are several views and tree:ViewDescription, LDES client works as expected

##	[2.3 Relations](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#relations)
#### *2.3.1 The tree:Relationâ€™s tree:value SHOULD be set.*
- [ ] Check that all tree:Relationâ€™s tree:value are set. 
#### *2.3.2 The object of tree:value SHOULD be accompanied by a data type when it is a literal value.*
- [ ] Check that every tree:Relation's tree:value is accompanied by a data type when it is a literal value.

#### *2.3.3 Every tree:Relation SHOULD have a tree:path, indicating the path from the member to the object on which the tree:Relation applies.*
- [ ] Check that every tree:Relation has a tree:path property set 
#### *2.3.4 When traversing, a client SHOULD keep a list of already visited pages, as despite this being the TREE spec, circular references and back-links are not explicitly prohibited*
- [ ] Verify behavior of the client.
> #FIXME: client conformance included??

#### *2.3.5 When using relations such as tree:LessThanRelation or tree:GreaterThanRelation, the time literals need to be compared according to these 3 possible data types: xsd:date, xsd:dateTime or xsd:dateTimeStamp.*
- [ ] Verify that the LDES Server's supported time fragmentation works as expected with following data types:
	- [ ] xsd:date
	- [ ] xsd:dateTime
	- [ ] xsd:dateTimeStamp.

## [2.4 Searching through the collection](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#searching)
## [2.5 Imports](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#imports)
#### *2.5.1 A `tree:importStream` can also be defined for providing a pub-sub interface for subscribing to real-time updates. The object SHOULD be a [[websockets]](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#biblio-websockets) or Server-Sent Events ([[eventsource]](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#biblio-eventsource)).*

####	*2.5.2 [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#biblio-vocab-dcat-2) is the standard for Open Data Portals by W3C. In order to find TREE compliant datasets in data portals, there SHOULD be a `dcat:accessURL` from the `dcat:Distribution` to the entrypoint where the `tree:Collection`s are described. Furthermore, there SHOULD be a `dct:conformsTo` this URI: `https://w3id.org/tree`.*
 - [ ] Verify that the LDES server root lists all tree:Collections and tree:Views and that the corresponding view descriptions include a dct:conformsTo property with the value https://w3id.org/tree

####	*2.5.3 Therefore, when using AS (Activity Streams 2.0) collections, a client implementation should gather the members from the `tree:Node` or `as:CollectionPage` instead.*

# [3 The Tree Specification](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction) [Optional ðŸŸ¦]
> A failing MAY-test does conformance but will result in a lower conformance score. The only strict requirement is that the server handles the test gracefully. Failure to do so will result in non-conformance.

##	[3.1 Collections](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#introduction)
##	[3.2 Core Concept](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#core-concepts)
#### *3.2.1 Three properties MAY thus be used:*
	1.  `ex:C1 tree:view <> .`  
	    May be used  _only_  in the case when the entire  `tree:Collection`  can be found starting from the current node.	    
	2.  `ex:C1 void:subset <> .`  
	    When the node is not a node from which all members can be found, but still a subset of the collection can be found.	    
	3.  `<> dcterms:isPartOf ex:C1 .`  

 - [ ]  Check when any mentioned properties are used, LDES Server doesn't crash for ingesting stream.
 > #FIXME: not sure about this, also client behavior.
 - [ ]  Check when any mentioned properties are used, LDES Client doesn't crash for subscribed stream.
> #FIXME: not sure about this, also client behavior.
 
####	*3.2.2 Multiple tree:view links MAY be provided*
- [ ] Check that LDES Server supports multiple view links per collection

####	*3.2.3 Note: For compatibility with the Solid specifications, a ShEx shape may also be given (see the chapter on compatibility bellow).*
- [ ] Check that when an LDES collection is annotated with a  `ShEx shape `, the LDES server works as expected

##	[3.3 Relations](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#relations)

####  *3.3.1 A tree:Node element MAY have one or more tree:relation properties.*
- [ ] verify support for multiple relations (e.g., by using geospacial or substring fragmentation).

####	*3.3.2 A relation is an entity of the type tree:Relation, and MAY have a more specific type.*
####	*3.3.3 All possible combinations of e.g., `shacl:alternativePath`, `shacl:inversePath` or `shacl:inLanguage` in the SHACL spec can be used.*
- [ ] verify support for SHACL property paths in tree:Relations.

####	*3.3.4 Every tree:Relation MAY provide a tree:remainingItems.*
####	*3.3.5 A client MAY use tree:remainingItems to estimate the completeness of the downloaded elements to the end-user.*
- [ ] Verify support for `tree:remainingItems `.
- [ ] Check when   `tree:remainingItems ` is set. LDES Client doesn't crash for subscribed stream.
> #FIXME: client behavior?
####	*3.3.6 A tree:import MAY be defined in the tree:Relation instance.*
- [ ] Verify LDES server support for imports.
> #fixme: NON-TESTABLE no clue on how to specify imports at the ingest side.
- [ ] Check when  `tree:import  ` is set. LDES Client doesn't crash for subscribed stream
> #FIXME: client behavior?
####	*3.3.7 When there are no `tree:member`s and/or no `tree:Collection` defined, then the `tree:path` refers to a pattern that can start from every triple in the page.*
- [ ] Verify support for pages with no `tree:member`s and/or no `tree:Collection` defined.
> #fixme: NON-TESTABLE
- [ ] Check when no `tree:member`s and/or no `tree:Collection` defined is set. LDES Client doesn't crash for subscribed stream
> #FIXME: client behavior?
####	*3.3.8 When a `tree:path` is defined, mind that you also may have to check the language of the element using the property `shacl:inLanguage` More languages MAY be set. When no language is set, all strings are compared.*
- [ ] Verify LDES server support for `shacl:inLanguage`.
> What does that imply? If you have a langauge that you only gragment for that langauge??

####	*3.3.8 A `tree:path` MAY refer to an implicit property*
- [ ] Check when  `tree:path` refers to an implicit property, the LDES Server doesn't crash.

## [3.4 Searching through the collection](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#searching)
## [3.5 Imports](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#imports)
####	*3.5.1 On the resources to import, Memento [[RFC7089]](https://treecg.github.io/specification/#biblio-rfc7089) controls MAY be provided for historic versions.*

####	*3.5.2 A client MAY infer a tree:shape of the collection through the st:validatedBy property of the Shapes Tree.*
