#### Q 2:     
##### 2.   Why the LDES Client needs to check for ViewDescriptions on both the current node without the tree:viewDescription qualification, as on the current node with the tree:viewDescription link.? What does this mean?

> https://treecg.github.io/specification/#view-description : A tree:Node
> can also be double typed as the tree:ViewDescription. A client must
> thus check for ViewDescriptions on both the current node without the
> tree:viewDescription qualification, as on the current node with the
> tree:viewDescription link.
